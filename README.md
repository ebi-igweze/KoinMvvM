# Koin MVVM

This is a simple project that show cases the features of [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/docs/1.0/documentation/reference/index.html), a lightweight and simple dependency injection framework written in kotlin. You can check out my blog post [here](https://android.jlelse.eu/koin-simple-android-di-a47827a707ce), where I explain each feature of the DI framework.

In this project I walk through the use cases for and features of [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/docs/1.0/documentation/reference/index.html), you can look at the [KoinTest](https://github.com/ebi-igweze/KoinMvvM/blob/master/app/src/test/java/com/igweze/ebi/koinmvvm/KoinTests.kt), to see tests on how each component falls in place.

That is it, happy coding.
